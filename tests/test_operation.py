# TODO: Add tests here that show the normal operation of this strategy
#       Suggestions to include:
#           - strategy loading and unloading (via Vault addStrategy/revokeStrategy)
#           - change in loading (from low to high and high to low)
#           - strategy operation at different loading levels (anticipated and "extreme")
